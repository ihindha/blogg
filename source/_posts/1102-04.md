What in predetermined is not the way that lead to the gaol. _**It is the gaol**_. Take Sauron for instance, his defeat was foretold when he abandoned Aulë and gave his allegiance to Melkor. He could have been defeated in the end of the second age. It was only becorse Isildur, by his free will, did not destroy the one ring Sauron was not utterly defeated.
